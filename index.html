Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create an app where the user can answer a short series of questions to find out their chances of having a cold or allergies based on their symptoms.
 
Known Issues:
This app should not be used to diagnose a real medical condition, it is merely a test.

//The two functions above add 1 to the allergy_count or cold_count variables every time they are run. This is done when the user clicks a button that corresponds with having allergies or a cold.//

//The function also changes the content of the HTML on the results page to allow the calculated probabilities to appear when the "Get Results" button is clicked.//
